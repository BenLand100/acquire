acquire is a readout program for CAEN Digitizers running pulse shape 
discrimination firmware (DPP-PSD). acquire reads parameters from JSON formatted
files containing all settings for programming a DDP-PSD digitizer along with
readout and data storage properties. The results are stored as raw samples in a 
structed HDF5 file along with attributes necessary to convert the samples into 
acquired voltages. Other useful digitizer information is also stored as 
attributes.

acquire depends on CAEN's Digitizer library and the HDF5 library.

To build, execute the script ./build.sh in the top directory

To use, ./acquire settings.json
