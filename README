acquire is a readout program for CAEN Digitizers running pulse shape 
discrimination firmware (DPP-PSD). acquire reads parameters from JSON formatted
files containing all settings for programming a DDP-PSD digitizer along with
readout and data storage properties. The results are stored as raw samples in a 
structed HDF5 file along with attributes necessary to convert the samples into 
acquired voltages. Other useful digitizer information is also stored as 
attributes.

acquire depends on CAEN's Digitizer library and the HDF5 library.

To build, execute the script ./build.sh in the top directory

To use, ./acquire settings.json

Example settings for the V1730 using `acquire` and `trigrate`

v1730_dpppsd is a low level control program specifically for the V1730
digitizer running DPP-PSD firmware communicating over a V1718 VME to USB bridge 
that depends only on CAENVMELib and HDF5 libraries. It is quite similar to 
acquire in functionality, but has access to V1730 specific functionality.
